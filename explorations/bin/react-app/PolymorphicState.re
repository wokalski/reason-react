/*
 * State is polymorphic, and determined based on the type of prop passed.
 * Previously in Reason React, this required creating a createMake() function,
 * that would create new classes of the component for each possible
 * instantiation of state. With dynamic trees, you need separate
 * `component`/`make`s for separate `state` types because you need to ensure
 * that the same `component`/`make` is not used to construct conflicting
 * states.
 *
 * With static trees, this isn't an issue because no two types could ever end
 * up in the same slot at render time, and therefore we don't need any
 * `createMake` helpers to use polymorphic state.
